Poker odds Calculator for Texas Hold'em in Java. Instructions are on the program, but you must enter in your cards number / face card initial first, then suit initial in capitals. Ex. 6S - 6 of Spades, QH - Queen of Hearts, AC - Ace of Clubs. 

This does an optimized brute force by first calculating all possible hands from the 2 base cards and continuously compares theoretical values.

This is meant for Texas Hold'ems most GENERAL case, when you are just handed your 2 cards. I limited this to 2 people, although it's trivial to add in a 3rd player. It's just computationally Intensive. It also is not necessary for the purpose of this program as this is meant to tell you which starting hands
are stronger than others.
